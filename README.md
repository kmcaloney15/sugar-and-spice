## Premise: 

Stay organized and manage your day-to-day with ClearSight!
This is a personal task management app, a place where you can create notes and todos that makes it easy to stay organized and manage your life. 

Happy organizing!


## Getting started:

## User Story:

- Users should be able to create their own profiles to get access to their notes and todos.
- Users should be able to create, edit and delete their own todos.
- Users should also be able to create, edit and delete their own categories to sort their notes and todos.

List of the routes used.

## Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- Css
- Mongodb
- Node.js
- Express
- React
- MERN

## MVP Requirements:
- Be a full-stack MERN application.
- Connect to and perform data operations on a Mongo database.
- If consuming an API, have at least one data entity (Model) in addition to the built-in User model. The related entity can be either a one-to-many (1:M) or a many-to-many (M:M) relationship.
- If not consuming an API, have at least two data entities (Models) in addition to the built-in User model. It is preferable to have at least one one-to-many (1:M) and one many-to-many (M:M) relationship between entities/models.
- Have full-CRUD *(Create, Read, Update, and Delete)* data operations across any combination of the app's models (excluding the User model). 
- Authenticate users using token-based authentication.
- Implement authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of data resources.
- Be deployed online using Heroku. Presentations must use the deployed application.



## Future goals:
- [x] Connect an api to add todos onto a calendar
- [ ] Dark mode
